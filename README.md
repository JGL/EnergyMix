# EnergyMix

EnergyMix uses the Space Grotesk 2.0 typeface:

[Space Grotesk](https://floriankarsten.github.io/space-grotesk/) is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant based on [Colophon Foundry's](https://www.colophon-foundry.org) fixed-width [Space Mono](https://github.com/googlefonts/spacemono) family (2016). Originally designed by [Florian Karsten](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com) in 2018, Space Grotesk retains the monospace's idiosyncratic details while optimizing for improved readability at non-display sizes.

## Space Grotesk 2.0 typeface License

Space Grotesk is licensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1, see [OFL.txt](OFL.txt) for details.
