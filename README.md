# EnergyMix

EnergyMix is a project to make initial prototypes of the [Inside concept](https://www.everyoneforever.com/a-lighting-product-which-reveals-its-current-energy-sources) from [Everyone Forever](https://www.everyoneforever.com/), the sister studio of [Universal Everything](https://www.universaleverything.com/).

EnergyMix is currently three prototypes:

1. A prototype based around the [Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression) 7 colour ePaper/eInk display for the Raspberry Pi, created by [Pimoroni Ltd.](https://github.com/pimoroni).
2. A prototype based around the [Plasma 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/plasma-2040) a USB-C powered controller for WS2812/Neopixel and APA102/Dotstar addressable LED strips, also from [Pimoroni Ltd.](https://github.com/pimoroni).
3. A prototype based around the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico?variant=32402092326995), combined with the [Pico Ominibus](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-omnibus) expander board and the [Pico Wireless Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-wireless-pack), also from [Pimoroni Ltd.](https://github.com/pimoroni).

EnergyMix relies on the [PV_Live platform from Sheffield University](https://api0.solar.sheffield.ac.uk/) for solar power generation information. PV_Live "provides a near realtime estimate of nationally- and regionally-aggregated electricity generation from solar Photovoltaics (PV) connected to the GB transmission network".

EnergyMix relies on the [Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service](https://bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=help/about-us) for other power generation information.

Huge thanks to both [Philip Howard aka Gadgetoid](https://github.com/Gadgetoid) and [Paul Beech](https://github.com/guru), both of Pimoroni Ltd for all their help on the project.

EnergyMix on the [Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression) uses the Space Grotesk 2.0 typeface:

[Space Grotesk](https://floriankarsten.github.io/space-grotesk/) is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant based on [Colophon Foundry's](https://www.colophon-foundry.org) fixed-width [Space Mono](https://github.com/googlefonts/spacemono) family (2016). Originally designed by [Florian Karsten](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com) in 2018, Space Grotesk retains the monospace's idiosyncratic details while optimizing for improved readability at non-display sizes.

## Space Grotesk 2.0 typeface License

Space Grotesk is licensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1, see [OFL.txt](OFL.txt) for details.
